# AWS DynamoDB - The Complete Guide

### Course by Riyaz Sayyad

[https://www.udemy.com/course/dynamodb/](https://www.udemy.com/course/dynamodb/)

This course represents the first use of my personal AWS account. We are beginning to use DynamoDB at work, and I wanted to deepen my knowledge of the concepts behind it.

The subdirectories have their own READMEs with more depth. For example, the README in /Sections1-6 has notes on setting up the account as well as documentation of the commands and concepts covered using the AWS CLI.

You should know, if you haven't yet purchased the course, that in order to complete 27.116: Building the iOS App, you must have a Mac with XCode installed. Also, check and see when it was last updated.

As of my experience with it (April 2020), it is outdated enough that I would not necessarily recommend it, unless it has been significantly updated since then. Though there is something to be said for having to troubleshoot and figure it out on your own when the way shown is no longer the way.

| Pros                                                                             | Cons                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Covers the basics pretty well                                                    | Really outdated, pagination section does not work                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Lots of explanation of how RCUs and WCUs are calculated                          | I got charged for the Cloudwatch alarms without any warning from the course, and then had to be on my guard for all the other non-free-tier sections                                                                                                          |
| Great to see how to set up a trigger using lambda                                | No discussion of serverless or writing lambda code outside of the console                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| You get pretty comfortable with most of the table tabs                           | Roles and IAM access are obnoxious mainly because of being outdated, I think                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Very clear about what has to be done at creation vs what you can change later on | Could have used a lot more demonstration of how indexes work in different situations, and how to structure data/indices depending on what kind of app you are building                                                                                        |
|                                                                                  | The final project was basically a wash, especially parts 2 & 3. Too much time spent setting up Angular 5, building mobile app with Ionic, setting up Google Cloud Platform and Firebase, and so on. Needs to keep the focus on Dynamo and minimize the noise. |
