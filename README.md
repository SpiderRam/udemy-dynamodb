This course represents the first use of my personal AWS account.  We are beginning to use DynamoDB at work, and I wanted to deepen my knowledge of the concepts behind it.

The subdirectories have their own READMEs with more depth.  For example, the README in /Sections1-6 has notes on setting up the account as well as documentation of the commands and concepts covered using the AWS CLI.
