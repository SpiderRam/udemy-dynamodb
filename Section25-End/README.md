# AWS DynamoDB - The Complete Guide

### SECTION 25: Project Part 1

The setup on this section is not super clean, it's a distraction from learning dynamo. You can code express from scratch with him if you like, try [npm express-generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-generator) if you want (but might be more trouble than it's worth to adapt to what the course is doing), or take the shortcut I usually avoid and download the starter code. I downloaded the starter code from Section 25.95, but it is outdated or broken and does not run without debugging. The code from 25.96 does work, though it's also old enough you will want to run `npm audit fix`. If you have experience with Express already this is pretty basic stuff, if not it is good to go through and see how each operation is set up.

### SECTION 26: Project Part 2

Sigh. Angular 5. I made the choice to just watch this section, as troubleshooting very elderly Angular code will not further my understanding of DynamoDB. You do you.

Also, Google Cloud Platform is another kind-of-free service. I don't plan to use it otherwise, and this course does not always warn you about things that will result in charges (probably because of changes since it was made), so again, passive viewing on the Cognito section for me.

### SECTION 27: Project Part 3

Mobile, with Ionic. Again, not exactly what I was looking for in this course, but interesting to watch.
